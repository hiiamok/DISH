# DISH
Distributed Image Search with Hadoop

##############################
1. Intro
##############################

DISH consists of 2 different parts

=== a) ImageFeaturesGenerator
		Generates a file including a list of all images and their imagefeatures (histogram)
	
=== b) ImageSearcher
		Takes a local file, generates imagefeatures and compares them to all other images stored in the
		ImageFeaturesGenerator generated file

DISH was developed and tested on Mac OS X Yosemite running Java SDK 8.
The GUI might look different of other platforms.

2. Usage
##############################

=== a) ImageFeaturesGenerator
	
		hadoop jar ImageFeaturesGenerator.jar [options]
		
		options:
			-i, --images <path>                     path hdfs image directory (default: /images)
			-if, --imagefeatures <path>             path to hdfs imagefeatures result (default: /imageFeatures)
			-mb, --maxbytes							            max memory size of one split (default: 1GB)
			-t, --time                              measure execution time
			--help                                  print usage information
			
=== b) ImageSearcher

		hadoop jar ImageSearcher.jar [options]
		
		options:
			-s, --search <path>                     path to local query image
			-i, --images <path>                     path hdfs image directory (default: /images)
			-if, --imagefeatures <path>             path to hdfs imagefeatures (default: /imageFeatures)
			-r, --results n                         number of results (default: 1)
			-o, --output <path>                     path to output (default: /DISH)
			-l, --lines								              max number of lines each mapper reads (default: 10000)
			-t, --time                              measure execution time
			--help                                  print usage information
			--cli                                   use commandline output instead of GUI

		Note: 	By default the ImageSearcher is trying to open a GUI.
				If you are on a server or want to run it on the command line please use the parameter --cli

3. Description
##############################

=== a) ImageFeaturesGenerator

		The ImageFeaturesGenerator takes an input directory of imagefiles, and generates an indexfile of
		all existing images.
		
		The generated file has the following format: filepath;imagefeatures;
		where imagefeatures is a String representation of an image histogram.
		
		(see SmallFileProblem.md for further information)
		
		The ImageFeaturesGenerator is implemented as a MapReduce algorithm without Reducer.
		For reading the image files saved on hdfs, a BinaryFileRecordReader was implemented.
		To Combine several BinaryFiles a BinaryFileInputFormat was defined.
		
		Info: The output of the ImageFeaturesGenerator will NOT be exactly one file.
		Since it was written for distributed usage, each mapper will generate one result-file
		in the defined output directory.
		
		This is also useful for the ImageSearcher, because the ImageSearcher can split it's task more easily.
		Still the ImageSearcher was designed in a way, that also 1 single input file would result in several mappers.
		Therefore it is possible to change the number of lines 1 mapper process reads.

=== b) ImageSearcher

		The ImageSearcher is implemented as a MapReduce algorithm with exactly one Reducer.
		
		The input for the mapper is the the generated result of the ImageFeaturesGenerator.
		To achieve a better performance of the mapper, not only one line is passed to one mappertask.
		Each mapper receives several lines at once, and calculates the euclidian distance for all of them.
		The top n results are passed on to the reducer.
		
		For passing results from the mappers to the reducer a Writable ImageDistanceMap was implemented.

		It is only 1 reducer called! The reducer receives all top-lists of the mappers.
		It then sorts this list, and gets the top n matching items, and writes them into an output file.
		
		In CLI mode the output file is read and printed.
		If the GUI is started, the result file is read, and all result-images are loaded from hdfs displayed.
